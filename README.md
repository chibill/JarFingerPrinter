# JarFingerPrinter
Fingerprints inputed jars into .json files.

Currently it is designed to work with minecraft and just inputting the version of the game to FingerPrint.

Also currently it requires two folders in its directory. (jars and also class_files)

It also requires another folder that is where it will export the .json files to.

In the end the main file will be rewrote to be more generic and also to be pep8.


Currently fingerprints for most MC versions and also snapshots starting that 16w22a are at https://minecraft16.ml/minecraft/jar_fingerprints
